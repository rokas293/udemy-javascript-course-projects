## [Guess My Number (Live)](https://sensational-ganache-a02ca5.netlify.app/)

This is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess a number between 0 and 20 in a maximum of 20 attempts. The game will end after 20 attempts and if the player failed to guess the number, and then he loses the game.
